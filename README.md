# LogSumExp Objectives for VLSI Placement
My bachelor thesis for the BSc in Mathematics at the University of Bonn.

## Original
You can find the original PDF [here](20200722_Bachelor%20Thesis.pdf). Some PDF features are only usable after downloading the document.

## Compiling
On Linux after the usual LaTeX setup (I used the TeX Live packages) clone this repository and run
```
mkdir build
pdflatex -synctex=1 -interaction=nonstopmode -output-directory=build main.tex
biber build/main.bcf
pdflatex -synctex=1 -interaction=nonstopmode -output-directory=build main.tex
```
The output can be found in `build/main.pdf`.
