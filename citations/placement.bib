  abstract = {Abstract For point sets in the rectilinear plane, we consider the following five measures of the interconnect length and prove bounds on the worst-case ratio: minimum Steiner tree, minimum star, clique, minimum spanning tree, and bounding box. In particular, we prove that, for any set of n points, (n − 1) times the shortest Steiner tree is less or equal to the clique unless n = 4 and the minimum spanning tree is less or equal to the shortest star unless n ∈ {3, 4, 5}. © 2001 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.},
