\chapter{Results} \label{chap:results}

In this chapter, we will use different netlength estimations (\(\NLSE\) and \(\NWA\)),
optimization methods and parameters 
to minimize the netlength of multiple chips to see how they perform.
This chapter focuses on comparisons between different configurations and will tackle the following questions:
\begin{itemize}
 \item Are the chosen optimization methods able to produce reasonable results?
 \item How closely do NLSE and NWA approximate HPWL during the optimization process?
 \item How do different starting positions influence the results?
 \item How do different step size strategies influence results and runtime?
 \item How do the generated placements look like?
\end{itemize}
